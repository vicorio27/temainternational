/**
 * A {@code Hierarchy} stores an arbitrary <i>forest</i> (an ordered collection of ordered trees)
 * as an array of node IDs in the order of DFS traversal, combined with a parallel array of node depths.
 *
 * <p>Parent-child relationships are identified by the position in the array and the associated depth.
 * Each tree root has depth 0, its children have depth 1 and follow it in the array, their children have depth 2 and follow them, etc.
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * <pre>
 * nodeIds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
 * depths:  0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>the forest can be visualized as follows:
 * <pre>
 * 1
 * - 2
 * - - 3
 * - - - 4
 * - 5
 * 6
 * - 7
 * 8
 * - 9
 * - 10
 * - - 11
 * </pre>
 * 1 is a parent of 2 and 5, 2 is a parent of 3, etc. Note that depth is equal to the number of hyphens for each node.
 *
 * <p>Invariants on the depths array:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Depth of the first element is 0.</li>
 *   <li>If the depth of a node is {@code D}, the depth of the next node in the array can be:
 *     <ul>
 *       <li>{@code D + 1} if the next node is a child of this node;</li>
 *       <li>{@code D} if the next node is a sibling of this node;</li>
 *       <li>{@code d < D} - in this case the next node is not related to this node.</li>
 *     </ul>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
